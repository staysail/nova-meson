# Meson Build Syntax For [Nova][1]

**Meson** provides syntax highlighting, folding, and indentation for the
[**Meson Build**][2] build recipes.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/staysail/nova-meson/main/screenshot.png)

Functionality is provided via a [Tree-sitter][3] grammar, so it should be
lightning fast.

This extension does *not* (yet?) handle automatic building of software with
Meson, or associated configuration tasks.

## Required

This extension only supports Nova 10.
